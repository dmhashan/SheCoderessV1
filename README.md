**_01) Vowey words_**
----------------
Shanu likes to make words. She likes to find Vowely Words from Novels. If word has even number of total vowel letters (a,e,i,o,u) and vowel letter count is less than or equal square root of total character count then only it is named as Vowely Word.

First line input has T number of test queries For each T lines there is a word

For each word you need to print YES if word is Vowely and otherwise NO

SAMPLE INPUT |	SAMPLE OUTPUT 
-------------|-----------------
love	     |	Yes
wow	     |	No


Explanation
T is 2 therefore there will be 2 words wow - vowel count is odd. We print NO love - vowel count is even and 2<=2 is true (vowel letter count is less than or equal square root of total character count). We print YES

**_02) Word Count_**
---------------------

Print the number of words in a given paragraph

Assumptions

Numeric values separated by spaces are considered as words (check example)
Words do not require to have a meaning, any set of letters separated by spaces or alphanumeric characters are considered a word

SAMPLE INPUT 					   |	SAMPLE OUTPUT 
-------------------------|---------------------------------------------
8 universities... 60 teams... 180 competitors....  |	6

------------------|-----------------------
12                |       yes

Explanation

Because given sample input is an Adam Number it prints yes. if it was otherwise answer should be no.

**_09)Soma's Cards_**
----------------------

Soma is learning Soft wear design in University of Slip. She is playing a game as per below steps.
She has N cards There is a number in both sides of a card (when they are in table only one side is visible). Each turn She can turn any cards at a time or do nothing. Once a round completes she sums all visible numbers and record it.
From those records she will find the largest number M
Finally she will decide how many cards she need to turn or not turn. She creates an array A using those turning or not turning state of cards.

Input Format

First line is N Next space seperated values of visible side of each card Final line gives space seperated values of invisible side of each card

Output Format

Display all possible turns she can do. Display the value of M and A using format as per below example
	29 ['No Turn', 'Turn', 'Turn', 'Turn']

M is 29 to get 29 she needs to do nothing for first card and turn all other cards to get other side

**_14)Goodland Electricity_**
------------------------------

Goodland is a country with n cities, and each city Ci is sequentially numbered from 0 to n-1. These cities are connected by n-1 roads, and each road connects Ci city to its neighboring city,Ci+1 . The distance between any two cities Ci and Cj is |i-j|.
Goodland's government started a project to improve the country's infrastructure and bring electricity to its citizens. It built at most one electrical tower in every city, but they haven't turned any of them on yet. Once switched on, each tower produces enough power to provide electricity to all neighboring cities at a distance <k from the tower.
Help the goverment by finding and printing the minimum number of towers they must switch on to ensure that all Goodland's cities have electricity. If this task is not possible for the given value of k and configuration of towers, print -1.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective number of cities in Goodland,n , and the tower's range constant,k. The second line contains n space-separated binary integers where each integer i(0<=i<n) denotes the number of electrical towers in city Ci. Recall that the number of towers in a city will always be either 0 or 1.

Constraints

1<=k<=n<=10^5
It is guaranteed that the number of electrical towers in each city will be either 0 or 1.

Subtask

1<=k<=n<=1000 for 40% of the maximum score.

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of changes the government must make so that all Goodland's cities have electricity; if this is not possible for the given value of k, print -1.
